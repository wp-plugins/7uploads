An easy to use - Linksave.in Wordpress Plugin - With Entry Possibilities

== Description ==

Latest Version available @ www.7-layers.at

The 7uploads Wordpress Plugin adds a Page to your Wordpress Installation where Users can easily enter
Links to their uploaded Files (images, videos,...) 

It requires the exec-php Plugin!

Users are able to enter the following types of data:
*	"Title" - The Title of the created Post - The Title of the Upload
*   "Cover" - An URL to a Cover, Image or anything else that will be shown in the final post
*   "Beschreibung" - A description of the Files uploaded
*   "Hoster" - The host where the files are :D
*   "Container" - DLC, RSDF or CCF -> the user can choose!
*   "Links" - The Links -> They have to be seperated by new lines
*   "Passwort" - If the Files are saved by a Password enter it here
*   "Upped by" - Enter your name =)

After the data is sent, the posts status is "draft". It will be published as soon as someone checked it ;)

The Look&Feel of the News Post can be easily changed by editing the preset article -> Keep in mind not to publish this one!
